# Robust-and-Fully-Dynamic-Coresets-for-Continuous-and-Bounded-Learning-With-Outliers-Problems

## Intro

This github repository contains the code for the paper "Robust and Fully Dynamic Coresets for Continuous and Bounded Learning With Outliers Problems".

## Command

unzip "data.zip" first, and then run the following commands:

```bash
nohup python -u coreset.py
```

```bash
nohup python -u dynamic.py
```

## Something to improve in the future

* Use relative path 
* We slightly modified the code in the module coresets. Documentation is not very clear. 
* The parameter of the coreset is written in the code instead of in the parameter file. It would be better to put them in the parameter file.
